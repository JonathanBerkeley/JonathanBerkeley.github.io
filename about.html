<p class="p1"> I am a student at IADT, doing a course called Creative Computing, it's great so far. IADT is a lot better than school was. Maybe it's because I'm now doing things that I'm more interested in, or else it's because of the better times, I don't have to get up as early. Or maybe it's because the people here are friendly. Actually, it's probably all of it put together.</p>
