<h2 class="essay">In my opinion, genetically modified organisms are a massive benefit to us. I personally believe that genetically modified food is the key to solving the massive problem of world hunger, one of the oldest problems the world has ever faced. I feel that we are on the brink of a breakthrough. We can have a window of opportunity to have crops that are not only resistant to weather damage and pests but which give more yield and are more nutritious. If we could create crops that produce food in dryer regions that could save millions of lives we absolutely should. Some think it is immoral to play god with any organisms, or that these genetically modified crops will have some unseen consequence in the future, this argument is easily dispelled, however. For example, the bible made no reference to morality on the issue of modifying organisms, and any unseen consequences of using genetically modified organisms is surely outweighed by the merit of saving millions of lives. I'm sure these people that would benefit from modified food would rather have food that could potentially (but unlikely) give them some small medical issues in the future rather than have no food at all.</h2>

<h2 class="essay">We have already seen the impressive success of the golden-rice, which was a genetically modified rice introduced to places that didn't have any vitamin-A in their diet. This saved many from malnourishment and meant that these people could start living a more normal life, it is estimated that the invention of golden-rice saves 350,000 people from blindness or vision impairment from vitamin-A deficiency per year. It's hard to believe that there are people, even after having seen the raw potential of genetically modified food, that still wish for genetically modified food to be either banned or restricted. We have finally unlocked a door down a path of potential. Potential to end this problem that has plagued humanity since it's conception. If we were to be able to make poorer countries self sufficient on genetically modified food, their rate of development would rapidly increase.   </h2>

<h2 class="essay">It is important to note what George Monbiot wrote on this topic, though, he provides a very lucid criticism to the hype surrounding the potential for GMOs to solve world hunger. "The world has a surplus of food, but still people go hungry. They go hungry because they cannot afford to buy it." It is therefore also important to understand that introducing a large amount of genetically modified food to the market will surely crash the market prices for non-gmo farmers, as food would be so easily produced that it would be almost worthless to farm using non-gmo crops. As such, biotech companies would have a complete monopoly on production of vegetative food.  This could be a problem as it would force a lot of farmers to switch to gmo creations. </h2>

<h2 class="essay">However I still don't believe this transition to genetically modified food should be too much of a problem. Foods are genetically modified over time through survival of the fittest and natural selection. It is therefore my belief that genetically modifying food is merely accelerating an already existing natural process which isn't immoral in the slightest, but it is instead a major step forward in the long road to defeating world hunger.</h2>
